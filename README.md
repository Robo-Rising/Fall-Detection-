# fall detection

## Overview

The IoT-Based Fall Detection System is designed to monitor and detect falls in real-time using a combination of sensors and cloud connectivity. It leverages the MPU6050 sensor, ESP32 microcontroller, and Blynk IoT platform for data processing and remote alerts.

## Components Used

1. **Hardware Components**:

   - **ESP32**: Microcontroller with WiFi capability for IoT integration.
   - **MPU6050**: Sensor for capturing acceleration and gyroscope data.
   - **Power Source**: Battery or USB for powering the ESP32.

2. **Software Components**:

   - **Blynk Platform**: For IoT connectivity, remote monitoring, and event logging.
   - **Arduino IDE**: Used for coding and uploading firmware to ESP32.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Fall Detection**:

  - Detects sudden acceleration spikes (impact phase) and low acceleration (still phase).
  - Validates falls using gyroscope data and time thresholds.

- **Remote Notifications**:

  - Sends alerts via Blynk when a fall is detected.
  - Logs sensor data for further analysis.

- **Accurate and Reliable**:

  - Uses threshold-based analysis for precise detection.
  - Ensures false alarms are minimized by incorporating validation windows.

## Thresholds and Parameters

| **Parameter**                | **Value** | **Purpose**                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Acceleration Spike Threshold | 2.5 g     | Detect sudden impact.              |
| Low Acceleration Threshold   | 0.5 g     | Confirm still phase after impact.  |
| Gyroscope Change Threshold   | 50 °/sec  | Detect abrupt orientation changes. |
| Fall Confirmation Window     | 1000 ms   | Validate fall within this time.    |
| Still Phase Min Duration     | 500 ms    | Minimum time for a confirmed fall. |

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:

   - ESP32 connects to WiFi using SSID and password.
   - MPU6050 sensor initializes for data capture.

2. **Sensor Data Monitoring**:

   - Accelerometer and gyroscope data are continuously read.
   - Total acceleration and gyroscope magnitude are calculated.

3. **Fall Detection Algorithm**:

   - Detects a potential fall when acceleration exceeds the threshold.
   - Monitors still phase to confirm the fall.
   - Cancels detection if criteria aren’t met within the validation window.

4. **Alert System**:

   - Logs the event to the Blynk platform.
   - Sends a "Fall Detected!" alert to connected devices.

## Code Highlights

```cpp
// Thresholds for fall detection
const float ACCEL_SPIKE_THRESHOLD = 2.5;  // Acceleration threshold (in g)
const float LOW_ACCEL_THRESHOLD = 0.5;   // Low acceleration threshold
const float GYRO_CHANGE_THRESHOLD = 50;  // Gyro threshold (degrees/sec)

// Detect fall based on acceleration and gyroscope data
void checkFall() {
  sensors_event_t a, g, temp;
  mpu.getEvent(&a, &g, &temp);

  float totalAccel = sqrt(a.acceleration.x * a.acceleration.x +
                          a.acceleration.y * a.acceleration.y +
                          a.acceleration.z * a.acceleration.z);

  float totalGyro = sqrt(g.gyro.x * g.gyro.x +
                         g.gyro.y * g.gyro.y +
                         g.gyro.z * g.gyro.z);

  if (totalAccel > ACCEL_SPIKE_THRESHOLD) {
    // Process fall detection logic...
  }
}
```
